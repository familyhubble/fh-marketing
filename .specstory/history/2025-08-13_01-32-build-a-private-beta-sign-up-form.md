# Build a private beta sign-up form (2025-08-12 21:32:19)

_**User**_

Lets build out a form for people to sign up for a private beta. The form will contain the following fields.

I’m going to build the full private beta sign-up form in `src/pages/private-beta.astro` with the exact fields you listed, keeping the file’s 2-space indentation and using your existing layout/styles.

- If you want this to submit somewhere now, I can add a lightweight handler under `src/pages/api/private-beta.ts` or integrate with your form platform.

- If the `martialStatus` key needs to remain spelled that way for compatibility, I kept it as-is in the `name` attribute while showing the label as “Marital status”. Same for `iosInterest` as a boolean checkbox.

- All indentation follows the file’s existing 2-space style.

- **What I changed**
  - Added a complete, styled form with fields: `FirstName`, `LastName`, `EmailAddress`, `iosInterest` (checkbox), `primaryDevice` (select), `interestReason` (textarea), `martialStatus` (select), `childrenCount` (number).
  - Kept names exactly as provided for form submission compatibility.
  - Included a header, helper text, image from `famImg`, and a submit button.
  - Preserved the file’s 2-space indentation and Astro/Tailwind conventions.

Would you like me to wire this up to a serverless endpoint (`/api/private-beta`) to capture submissions?

First lets implement that on the page. 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

I’m going to add the full form markup, with the specified fields, inside `src/pages/private-beta.astro` under the existing container, keeping the existing 2-space indentation and leaving backend wiring for later.

---



---



---

I added the form markup with the specified fields to `src/pages/private-beta.astro`, preserving the file’s 2-space indentation and leaving the submit handler for later. I’ll now check for any linter issues in that file.

---



---

- Implemented a full private beta sign-up form in `src/pages/private-beta.astro` with fields: `FirstName`, `LastName`, `EmailAddress`, `primaryDevice`, `childrenCount`, `martialStatus`, `iosInterest` (checkbox), and `interestReason`.
- Preserved existing 2-space indentation and current layout/styling.
- No linter errors detected.

Want me to wire this to an endpoint (e.g., `POST /api/private-beta`) or a form provider next?

Make the background for all fields white.

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Adding `bg-white` to all form field elements (`input`, `select`, `textarea`, and the checkbox) in `src/pages/private-beta.astro` to ensure white backgrounds across the form, preserving existing indentation and styles.

---



---



---

Done. All form fields now have a white background in `src/pages/private-beta.astro` (`bg-white` added to inputs, selects, textarea, and checkbox), with indentation preserved. No linter issues.

---

_**User**_

Now lets create an Astro action for this form. For now, console.info the results when submitted.

---

_**Assistant**_



---

I'll scan and update `src/pages/private-beta.astro` to point the form to a new server endpoint, then create `src/pages/api/private-beta.ts` to log submissions and return a simple response.

---



---

I’m going to check Astro’s current “Actions” API syntax to wire the form to submit to this page and log the posted data, then implement it in `src/pages/private-beta.astro`.

I'll add a new server action under `src/actions/privateBeta.ts` to log form submissions, and update `src/pages/private-beta.astro` to submit to that action. Then I’ll check for linter issues.

Adding server action support by creating `src/actions/index.ts` with a `server` export and wiring the page to it. Also disabling prerender on the form page so the action can run server-side. Running linter checks after.

Updating the actions to use the proper exported name and wiring the form to it. I’ll adjust the type shim to satisfy the linter, remove the extra actions file, and re-run lints.

---

- Wired the form to an Astro Action.
- Added `src/actions/index.ts` with `actions.privateBetaSignup` that logs submitted form data via console.info and returns `{ ok: true }`.
- Updated `src/pages/private-beta.astro` to import `actions` from `astro:actions` and set `action={actions.privateBetaSignup}` on the form.
- Set `export const prerender = false;` in `private-beta.astro` so the action runs server-side.
- Added a minimal type shim at `src/types/astro-actions.d.ts` to satisfy local linting.
- Lints are clean.

Submit the form and check your server logs to see the payload.

When I hit submit, I get the following error: `TypeError: Expected `server` export in actions file to be an object. Received undefined.`

---

_**Assistant**_



---

I’m going to check the correct Astro Actions export shape for v5.12.9, since the runtime complains about expecting a `server` export. Then I’ll update our `src/actions/index.ts` and the import in `private-beta.astro` accordingly, and re-run lints.

---

Updating the actions to export the required server object (and aliasing it as actions for the page import), removing the redundant actions file, and adjusting the type shim. Then I’ll recheck lints.

---



---

Remove redundant actions file to avoid confusion; index.ts is the entrypoint.

---



---



---

The error indicates Astro expects a `server` export from `src/actions/index.ts`. I updated actions to export `server` and aliased it as `actions` so your existing page import still works.

What I changed:
- `src/actions/index.ts`
  - Now exports `server` with `privateBetaSignup` via `defineAction`, and `export const actions = server;`.
  - Continues to console.info the submitted data and return `{ ok: true }`.
- Removed `src/actions/privateBeta.ts` to avoid conflicting action entrypoints.
- `src/types/astro-actions.d.ts`
  - Added both `server` and `actions` to satisfy local TS/lint until Astro generates types.
- Lints are clean.

Try submitting again; the action should now load and log to the server console.
