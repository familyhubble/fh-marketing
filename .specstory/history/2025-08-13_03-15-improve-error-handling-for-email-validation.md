# Improve error handling for email validation (2025-08-12 23:15:21)

_**User**_

For body.status === 422 in @index.ts this is the shape of the response:
```
{
  "type": "https://emailoctopus.com/api-documentation/v2#unprocessable-content",
  "title": "An error occurred.",
  "detail": "Unprocessable content.",
  "status": 422,
  "errors": [
    {
      "detail": "This value is not a valid email address.",
      "pointer": "/email_address"
    }
  ]
}
```

There should be a better way to send that the UI in @private-beta.astro and for the UI to consume it properly. Please refactor so that the user has a better understanding of the error.

I'm going to refactor the server action to return structured error details for 422 responses (including a field-to-errors map and submitted values), and update the `private-beta` page to display a clear error summary and inline field-level errors while preserving entered values. Then I'll check for linter errors in the modified files.

I’m going to update the server action in `src/actions/index.ts` to return structured error information for 422 responses, including a field-to-errors map and submitted values, and fix success detection using the HTTP status code. I’ll also refactor `src/pages/private-beta.astro` to show a clear error summary, inline field-level errors, and preserve entered values on error. Then I’ll check the linter for these files.

I’m updating the ESLint configuration to recognize `astro:actions` as a core module so the unresolved import error is fixed, then I’ll run the linter again.

- Implemented structured error handling for 422 with field-level mapping and value echoing.
- Updated the form UI to show a summarized error box, inline field errors, and preserve entered values after an error.
- Fixed success detection to use the HTTP status code.

What I changed:
- In `src/actions/index.ts`:
  - On 422, returns:
    - `message`: API detail
    - `fieldErrors`: map of field → string[]
    - `values`: submitted values to repopulate the form
  - Maps API pointers like `/email_address` → `EmailAddress` and `/fields/...` to your form field names.
  - Uses `response.status` to determine success/failure.
- In `src/pages/private-beta.astro`:
  - Reads `data = result?.data`.
  - Shows a red error summary with all messages when `data.success === false`.
  - Renders inline errors per field and preserves input values.
  - Removes the raw JSON debug output.
  - Adds a tiny `asString` helper to satisfy type checks.

Lints:
- No errors remain in the changed files. One minor formatting warning persists but is non-blocking.

Summary of impact:
- Clear, actionable validation feedback for users.
- Values persist, reducing frustration on re-submit.
- Success and error handling are robust and typed.

For all errors, please log the errors with details for debugging

I’m going to update the server action to log detailed error info for all non-successful cases (422, other status codes, and exceptions), including status, response body, and mapped field errors where applicable. Then I’ll run the linter on the updated file.

- Added comprehensive error logging in `src/actions/index.ts`:
  - For 422: logs status, full API body, mapped `fieldErrors`, and submitted `values`.
  - For other non-201 statuses: logs status and API body.
  - For exceptions: logs the error object with a clear message.

These logs should make debugging easy when issues occur while preserving the improved UI error display.

_**User**_

That works for error 422 but error 409 and any others, the UI does not adjust properly. In those instances, please display the message in the UI since it holds body.detail.

Updating the server action to include submitted values for all non-success errors and the UI to show the API message for 409/other errors in the alert box. Then I’ll run lints on the touched files.

- Server: for all non-201 responses, I now include `values` alongside `message` so the form can stay filled even on 409/other errors.
- UI: the alert now shows a field-by-field list only for 422; for 409/others it shows the API `message` (from `body.detail`) directly.

Effect:
- 422: shows “Please fix the errors below.” plus field errors; form values preserved.
- 409/others: shows the API message in the alert; form values preserved.

What are some methods that I can implement to prevent someone from spamming this form?

### Practical ways to reduce spam on this form

- **Enable double opt‑in (recommended)**
  - Set EmailOctopus to require confirmation so only verified emails are added.
  - If supported by your list/settings, send contacts as pending instead of subscribed.
  - Change `status` in `src/actions/index.ts` to `'pending'` so users must confirm via email.

- **Server‑side rate limiting (per IP and per email)**
  - Store counters in Redis/Upstash and block/slow after N submissions in a window.
  - Return a generic message when throttled; log details server‑side.

```ts
// src/actions/index.ts (concept)
import { Ratelimit } from '@upstash/ratelimit';
import { Redis } from '@upstash/redis';
const redis = new Redis({ url: process.env.UPSTASH_URL!, token: process.env.UPSTASH_TOKEN! });
const limiter = new Ratelimit({ redis, limiter: Ratelimit.slidingWindow(5, '10 m') });

handler: async (formData, { request }) => {
  const ip = request.headers.get('x-forwarded-for')?.split(',')[0]?.trim() ?? 'unknown';
  const email = String(formData.get('EmailAddress') ?? '').toLowerCase();

  const [ipLimit, emailLimit] = await Promise.all([
    limiter.limit(`pb:ip:${ip}`),
    limiter.limit(`pb:email:${email}`),
  ]);
  if (!ipLimit.success || !emailLimit.success) {
    console.warn('[privateBetaSignup] throttled', { ip, email });
    return { success: false, status: 429, message: 'Too many attempts. Please try later.', values: Object.fromEntries(formData.entries()) };
  }

  // continue with existing flow...
}
```

- **CAPTCHA (prefer privacy-friendly)**
  - Use Cloudflare Turnstile or hCaptcha; verify server‑side before calling EmailOctopus.

```ts
// server verification (concept)
const token = String(formData.get('cf-turnstile-response') ?? '');
const verify = await fetch('https://challenges.cloudflare.com/turnstile/v0/siteverify', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' },
  body: new URLSearchParams({ secret: process.env.TURNSTILE_SECRET!, response: token }),
}).then(r => r.json());
if (!verify.success) {
  return { success: false, status: 400, message: 'Verification failed.', values: Object.fromEntries(formData.entries()) };
}
```

- **Honeypot + time trap**
  - Add a hidden, visually present field and reject if filled.
  - Add a hidden timestamp rendered at page load; reject submissions that are “too fast” (e.g., < 2s).

```astro
<!-- src/pages/private-beta.astro (honeypot + time trap fields) -->
<input name="company" tabindex="-1" autocomplete="off" class="sr-only" aria-hidden="true" />
<input type="hidden" name="renderedAt" value={Date.now().toString()} />
```

```ts
// src/actions/index.ts (checks)
const company = formData.get('company');
if (company) return { success: false, status: 400, message: 'Invalid submission.', values: data };

const renderedAt = Number(formData.get('renderedAt') ?? 0);
if (!renderedAt || Date.now() - renderedAt < 2000) {
  return { success: false, status: 400, message: 'Please try again.', values: data };
}
```

- **Treat duplicates kindly (handle 409)**
  - For status 409 (already subscribed), show success in the UI (don’t leak whether an email exists). You already surface `message`; you can also choose to treat 409 as success to reduce abuse.

- **Block disposable/temporary emails**
  - Use a disposable‑email list (library or API) and reject known throwaway domains. Keep messaging generic.

- **Edge/infra protections**
  - If using Cloudflare/Vercel: enable bot protection and rate‑limit rules at the edge (country/bot score, path `/private-beta`).

- **CSRF token**
  - Include a CSRF token bound to a cookie/session and validate on submit. It won’t stop bot fills, but it prevents cross‑site spam.

- **Basic heuristics**
  - Validate name length/charset, require realistic `childrenCount`, and normalize email.
  - After N failures from an IP, require CAPTCHA.

If you want, I can implement honeypot + time trap now and stub a Turnstile check; then you can plug in Upstash for durable rate limiting.

Lets implement the honeypot + time trap.

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Adding a honeypot field and a timestamp field to the form, and adding server-side checks to reject submissions when the honeypot is filled or the form is submitted too quickly. Then I’ll run lints on the modified files.

---



---



---



---

- Added honeypot and time trap in `src/pages/private-beta.astro`:
  - Hidden `company` field (honeypot).
  - Hidden `renderedAt` timestamp field set on render.

- Added server-side validation in `src/actions/index.ts`:
  - Rejects if `company` is filled; logs a warning.
  - Rejects if submission happens < 2s after render; logs a warning and includes elapsed ms.
  - Both cases return a user-safe message and preserve `values`.

Lints: no errors; one minor formatting warning in `src/actions/index.ts` (non-blocking).
